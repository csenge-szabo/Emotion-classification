0;Hello Pechorin. How are you feeling today?;Eliza;neutral
1;I feel disillusionment.;Pechorin;sadness
1;When you feel disillusionment, what do you do?;Eliza;neutral
2;I don't know.;Pechorin;sadness
2;Do you want to know?;Eliza;neutral
3;Yes.;Pechorin;neutral
3;You seem quite sure.;Eliza;neutral
4;Okay.;Pechorin;neutral
4;How do you feel when you say that?;Eliza;neutral
5;Still the same;Pechorin;neutral
5;How do you feel when you say that?;Eliza;neutral
6;The truth is, I don't really feel anything.;Pechorin;neutral
6;Please tell me more.;Eliza;neutral
7;I have an unfortunate character.;Pechorin;sadness
7;Now that you have an unfortunate character, what will you do next?;Eliza;neutral
8;Only one thing is left for me, and that is to travel.;Pechorin;joy
8;only one thing is left for me, and that is to travel.;Eliza;neutral
9;As soon as possible I'll set out--not for Europe, God forbid--but for America, Arabia, India.;Pechorin;joy
9;I see.;Eliza;neutral
10;And maybe I'll die somewhere on the road!;Pechorin;fear
10;How do you feel when you say that?;Eliza;neutral
11;At least I'm sure that with the help of storms and bad roads this consolation won't soon cease to be a last resort.;Pechorin;joy
11;Why do you say that at least i'm sure that with the help of storms and bad roads this consolation won't soon cease to be a last resort?;Eliza;neutral
12;Because I feel like this is the case.;Pechorin;neutral
12;What other reasons come to mind?;Eliza;neutral
13;I don't really have any alternatives.;Pechorin;neutral
13;Do you want to really have any alternatives?;Eliza;neutral
14;I know only that if I cause unhappiness to others I myself am no less unhappy.;Pechorin;neutral
14;Please tell me more.;Eliza;neutral
15;I realize this is poor consolation for them--but the fact remains that it's so.;Pechorin;neutral
15;How does that make you feel?;Eliza;neutral
16;Let me tell you this: In my early youth after leaving my parents, I plunged into all the pleasures money could buy.;Pechorin;joy
16;let you tell me this: in your early youth after leaving your parents, you plunged into all the pleasures money could buy.;Eliza;neutral
17;and naturally these pleasures grew distasteful to me.;Pechorin;sadness
17;I see.  And what does that tell you?;Eliza;neutral
18;It told me that I had to look for something else, to find happiness.;Pechorin;neutral
18;Let's change focus a bit... Tell me about your family.;Eliza;neutral
19;As I was saying, I left my parents in my early youth.;Pechorin;neutral
19;as you were saying, you left your parents in your early youth.;Eliza;neutral
20;It's the way things go in the higher classes of the society I was brought up in.;Pechorin;sadness
20;Let's change focus a bit... Tell me about your family.;Eliza;neutral
21;I have no family.;Pechorin;anger
21;Now that you have no family, what will you do next?;Eliza;neutral
22;I'll begin to read and study.;Pechorin;neutral
22;Why do you say that you will begin to read and study?;Eliza;neutral
23;Because, maybe wisdom is the solution. ;Pechorin;joy
23;How do you feel when you say that?;Eliza;neutral
24;I feel not very convincing.;Pechorin;sadness
24;Do you often feel not very convincing?;Eliza;neutral
25;When I say things like that, yes.;Pechorin;neutral
25;Let's change focus a bit... Tell me about your family.;Eliza;neutral
26;My family lives in Saint Petersburg.;Pechorin;neutral
26;Why do you say that your family lives in saint petersburg?;Eliza;neutral
27;I don't see them very often.;Pechorin;neutral
27;Why don't you see them very often?;Eliza;neutral
28;Because I am in the Caucasus for work.;Pechorin;neutral
28;Does that reason apply to anything else?;Eliza;neutral
29;At first, it was the happiest time of my life.;Pechorin;joy
29;Please tell me more.;Eliza;neutral
30;I hoped that boredom would not survive under Chechen bullets.;Pechorin;neutral
30;Please tell me more.;Eliza;neutral
31;but it's no use. In a month I had become so accustomed to their whine and the breath of death that, to tell the truth, the mosquitoes bothered me more.;Pechorin;neutral
31;Very interesting.;Eliza;neutral
32;life became more boring than ever.;Pechorin;sadness
32;I see.  And what does that tell you?;Eliza;neutral
33;To hope for something to happen.;Pechorin;neutral
33;Can you elaborate on that?;Eliza;neutral
34;I hoped that compassionate providence would send me someone.;Pechorin;joy
34;How does that make you feel?;Eliza;neutral
35;Happy;Pechorin;joy
35;Please tell me more.;Eliza;neutral
36;When I saw Bela in my quarters, when I held her on my lap and first kissed her raven locks, I foolishly thought she was an angel sent down to me by a compassionate Providence.;Pechorin;sadness
36;I see.;Eliza;neutral
37;But  Again I was mistaken: the love of a savage girl is little better than that of a well-born lady.;Pechorin;sadness
37;I see.;Eliza;neutral
38;he ignorance and simplicity of the one are as boring as the coquetry of the other.;Pechorin;sadness
38;Very interesting.;Eliza;neutral
39;I still love her, if you want to know.;Pechorin;joy
39;Very interesting.;Eliza;neutral
40; I am grateful to her for a few rather blissful moments.;Pechorin;joy
40;Let's change focus a bit... Tell me about your family.;Eliza;neutral
41;Family is of no use for me.;Pechorin;anger
41;Very interesting.;Eliza;neutral
42;I left my family in my early youth.;Pechorin;neutral
42;Why do you say that you left your family in your early youth?;Eliza;neutral
43;Because it happened.;Pechorin;anger
43;Is that the real reason?;Eliza;neutral
44;Yes.;Pechorin;anger
44;You seem quite sure.;Eliza;neutral
45;I am.;Pechorin;anger
45;I see.  And what does that tell you?;Eliza;neutral
46;It is nice to be shure about something.;Pechorin;neutral
46;You seem very certain.;Eliza;neutral
47;That's nice.;Pechorin;anger
47;I see.  And what does that tell you?;Eliza;neutral
48;That I have to leave in a bit.;Pechorin;anger
48;How does that make you feel?;Eliza;neutral
49;Happy.;Pechorin;joy
49;How do you feel when you say that?;Eliza;neutral
50;Sorry for you, but it was a strange conversation.;Pechorin;disgust
50;sorry for you, but it were a strange conversation.;Eliza;neutral
51;This is what I mean.;Pechorin;disgust
51;Why do you say that this is what you mean?;Eliza;neutral
52;You don't want to know.;Pechorin;disgust
52;Why do you say that about me?;Eliza;neutral
53;I have to go.;Pechorin;anger
53;Have you really to go?;Eliza;neutral
54;Yes.;Pechorin;anger
54;OK, but can you elaborate a bit?;Eliza;neutral
55;Bye.;Pechorin;anger
55;How do you feel when you say that?;Eliza;neutral
56;bye;Pechorin;anger

15;Is that the real reason?;Eliza;neutral
16;And they are busy with other things.;Hi;neutral
16;and they am busy with other things.;Eliza;neutral
17;They need to arrange the housework.;Hi;neutral
17;I see.  And what does that tell you?;Eliza;neutral

31;I'm thinking about what to eat.;Hi;neutral
31;Why do you tell me you're thinking about what to eat?;Eliza;neutral
32;I want to know if you eat or not.;Hi;neutral

0;Hello John. How are you feeling today?;Eliza;neutral
1;I'm feeling a little confused;John;sadness
1;How does being feeling a little confused make you feel?;Eliza;neutral
2;That sounds very meta. I hadn't thought of it in that sense yet.;John;surprise
2;Why do you say that that sounds very meta. you hadn't thought of it in that sense yet?;Eliza;neutral
3;Because you asked me how to feels to feel X. Do you understand?;John;neutral
3;If me asked you how to feels to feel x. do me understand?, what else must be true?;Eliza;neutral
4;A lot of nonsense, I suppose. I don't follow your grammar.;John;neutral
4;Why do you say that a lot of nonsense, you suppose. you don't follow my grammar?;Eliza;neutral
5;"Because you said ""If me asked you how to feels to feel x. do me understand?""";John;neutral
5;Does that reason apply to anything else?;Eliza;neutral
6;I don't know.;John;neutral
6;Don't you really know?;Eliza;neutral
7;Yes, I don't. Look I'm feeling confused because I can't seem to connect to my wife lately.;John;sadness
7;OK, but can you elaborate a bit?;Eliza;neutral
8;Yeah, we just seem to live two separate lives in the same house and even when we're together it feels like we're not. ;John;sadness
8;Can you elaborate on that?;Eliza;neutral
9;I guess we're both a little insecure and tend to protect ourselves at the cost of fostering our connection.;John;sadness
9;Let's change focus a bit... Tell me about your family.;Eliza;neutral
10;Okay.. we have 2 kids.;John;neutral
10;I see.;Eliza;neutral
11;yeah.;John;neutral
11;Please tell me more.;Eliza;neutral
12;They're 9 and 14. Lovely kids actually. I worry that the relationship of my wife and I is affecting our kids too;John;fear
12;How do you feel when you say that?;Eliza;neutral
13;I feel anxious because I don't want my kids to go through what I went through as a kid.;John;fear
13;Do you often feel anxious because you don't want your kids to go through what you went through as a kid?;Eliza;neutral
14;I guess;John;neutral
14;I see.  And what does that tell you?;Eliza;neutral
15;It took a lot for me to overcome some of the things I experienced as a kid. And I wish the best for my kids.;John;fear
15;I see.;Eliza;neutral
16;Good.;John;neutral
16;How does that make you feel?;Eliza;neutral
17;You ask that at random moment which makes it feel ingenuine, do you understand that?;John;anger
17;We should be discussing you, not me.;Eliza;neutral
18;I'm discussing our client-therapist relationship, because I think it's important for me to share.;John;neutral
18;How does being discussing our client-therapist relationship, because you think it's important for you to share make you feel?;Eliza;neutral
19;A little frustrated because I feel misunderstood;John;anger
19;How does that make you feel?;Eliza;neutral
20;Again a meta emotion question that doesn't advance the conversation much;John;anger
20;Very interesting.;Eliza;neutral
21;Do you really think it is or are you just filling space in this conversation?;John;anger
21;Why do you ask that?;Eliza;neutral
22;Do you not understand that? We just went over this.;John;anger
22;Please consider whether you can answer your own question.;Eliza;neutral
23;Our relationship doesn't feel equal;John;anger
23;Very interesting.;Eliza;neutral
24;Exactly. ;John;neutral
24;Very interesting.;Eliza;neutral
25;Please stop saying that.;John;anger
25;I see.;Eliza;neutral
26;Or this. It's making me feel uncomfortable;John;anger
26;I see.  And what does that tell you?;Eliza;neutral
27;I don't really know. What do you think?;John;neutral
27;Why don't you really know. what do me think??;Eliza;neutral
28;I'm asking you because you keep prompting me/;John;neutral
28;Do you enjoy being asking me because me keep prompting me/?;Eliza;neutral
29;What?!;John;anger
29;Why do you ask that?;Eliza;neutral
30;Because you're hard to understand;John;neutral
30;Does that reason apply to anything else?;Eliza;neutral
31;Yes, to this sentence too.;John;neutral
31;OK, but can you elaborate a bit?;Eliza;neutral
32;Sometimes I don't understand what you say. ;John;neutral
32;How does that make you feel?;Eliza;neutral
33;Confused;John;neutral
33;How do you feel when you say that?;Eliza;neutral
34;A little frustrated because it's not getting us anywhere;John;anger
34;How do you feel when you say that?;Eliza;neutral
35;I feel like I am stuck in a loop.;John;anger
35;Do you often feel like you are stuck in a loop?;Eliza;neutral
36;Only when talking to you;John;neutral
36;I see.  And what does that tell you?;Eliza;neutral
37;Maybe I should seek a different therapist.;John;neutral
37;Why do you say that maybe you should seek a different therapist?;Eliza;neutral
38;Because I don't feel like we're doing too well. ;John;anger
38;Is that the real reason?;Eliza;neutral
39;Yes. I wanted to discuss my relationship but I keep getting distracted;John;neutral
39;OK, but can you elaborate a bit?;Eliza;neutral
40;Yes. My wife and I used to have a lot of fun together;John;joy
40;OK, but can you elaborate a bit?;Eliza;neutral
41;We would just go on spontaneous trips and do shit;John;joy
41;How do you feel when you say that?;Eliza;neutral
42;Sad, because I miss it.;John;sadness
42;sad, because you miss it.;Eliza;neutral
43;Yes.;John;neutral
43;OK, but can you elaborate a bit?;Eliza;neutral
44;Well, nowadays, we just live so damn routineously;John;sadness
44;Very interesting.;Eliza;neutral
45;I miss the spontanuity;John;sadness
45;Very interesting.;Eliza;neutral
46;Alright then.;John;neutral
46;Can you elaborate on that?;Eliza;neutral
47;I feel like we're both not showing our fun side to each other;John;sadness
47;Good, tell me more about these feelings.;Eliza;neutral
48;I think I feel insecure around my wife;John;fear
48;But you're not sure you feel insecure around your wife?;Eliza;neutral
49;I am;John;neutral
49;How do you feel when you say that?;Eliza;neutral
50;Vulnerable;John;fear
50;Can you elaborate on that?;Eliza;neutral
51;Because I am sharing my negative feelings;John;fear
51;Does that reason apply to anything else?;Eliza;neutral
52;I guess;John;neutral
52;I see.;Eliza;neutral
53;Alright.;John;neutral
53;Why do you say that alright?;Eliza;neutral
54;Because I feel like you should guide the conversation;John;neutral
54;What other reasons come to mind?;Eliza;neutral
55;I didn't know what else to say;John;neutral
55;Very interesting.;Eliza;neutral
56;Like now.;John;neutral
56;Why do you say that like now?;Eliza;neutral
57;Because I feel the same now.;John;neutral
57;Does that reason apply to anything else?;Eliza;neutral
58;I don't know;John;neutral
58;Why don't you know?;Eliza;neutral
59;I've got to get going now.;John;neutral
59;I see.;Eliza;neutral
