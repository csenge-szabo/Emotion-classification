# Emotion Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the project files for the "Introduction to Human Language Technology" course, part of the Masterâ€™s degree in Computational Linguistics at VU Amsterdam. The project focuses on emotion classification using machine learning models, analyzing data from annotated conversations to detect emotional states.

## Repository Content

### Folders
- `data`: Contains the dataset files. Due to the size of these files (Airline Tweets, Wassa, Smile, MELD), they were not uploaded 
- `models`: Contains the trained models. Due to their large size, these were not uplaoded.

### Files
- `2022_2023_eliza.csv`: Dataset of annotated Eliza conversations.
- `Csenge_Szabo_Final_Report.pdf`: Detailed report on the project's findings and methodologies.
- `lab5_util.py`: Python script with helper functions used across the notebooks.
- `lab5.final_assignment_instructions_Csenge_Szabo.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook detailing the final assignment experiments.
